Hi there!

This is the code for my personal website at sjwebdev.com.

It's pretty much all experimental work. A playground for me to learn in but with some practical purpose.

So with the word EXPERIMENTAL and LEARNING ENVIRONMENT firmly in mind, please feel free to browse around and checkout what I'm playing with now.

Thanks,

Simon
